# Bottom Line

By Terminal Velocity

    Bottom Line is a cyberpunk themed 3D combat racer. It is set in a future where the galaxy is controlled
    by corporations that advertise wherever they can, especially in the annual Bottom Line galactic race.
    Players don’t just win this race by the place they finished in, they win by obtaining more hype points
    than their competition! Players can gain Hype for the company they are representing by destroying their
    opponents’ vehicles and having shorter lap times compared to them. The game is up to 4 player, couch co-op.
    Don’t worry if you don’t have enough players though as bots can participate in their place.
